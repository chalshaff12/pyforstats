# pyforstats


This project contains my work on a course called **Python for Statistical Analysis** that I am taking on Udemy. 

The course uses python for statistical data analysis, giving a good foundation of data science.

I am using Jupyter notebooks instead of regular .py files because I want to include notes and documentation for myself in an easy-to-read way for future reference. 
Juypter is also helpful to run pieces of code without re-running the entire file, allowing me to try out different things easily.
